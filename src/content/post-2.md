Of course you would write the first blog post about creating the actual blog itself. So do I.

# Install Gatsby
First of all, we need to install [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which will generate the static blog pages

```
$ brew install gatsby-cli
```

# Create a blog based on a
```shell
$ gatsby new <name_of_the_blog> <template_url>
$ gatsby new blog https://github.com/niklasmtj/gatsby-starter-julia
```
# Start the blog and customise it

```
$ gatsby develop
```
The blog gets refreshed automatically when you save the files in your IDE
